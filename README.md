# CROSS BORDER ACTIVITIES ANALYSIS


Project Overview::

This project is an analysis of cross-border activities between Country A and Country B, aimed at identifying potential threats, patterns, and making informed recommendations based on the provided data. The project involves multiple tasks, including geospatial analysis, satellite details interpretation, OSINT correlation, and threat assessment.

Data Sources::

Geospatial Data: Contains GPS coordinates, timestamps, locations, and movement types (entry/exit) for the past 6 months.
Satellite Details: Satellite imagery data covering key areas along the border between Country A and Country B.
News Reports: Recent news articles and social media posts related to cross-border incidents.
Historical Incidents Database: A summary of past border incidents, including dates, locations, and outcomes.

Project Tasks and Deliverables::

1. Geospatial Analysis
Task: Analyze geospatial data to identify areas with significant cross-border movements. Utilize GIS tools to create heat maps and identify hotspots.
Deliverable: A slide summarizing findings, including visualizations of movement patterns, hotspots, and discussions on anomalies.
2. Satellite Details Interpretation
Task: Review satellite details to identify changes or activities related to cross-border movements, focusing on new infrastructure, troop deployments, or other significant changes.
Deliverable: A slide summarizing the analysis of satellite data.
3. Correlation with Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
Task: Cross-reference geospatial and satellite imagery findings with news reports and social media posts. Identify corroborating evidence or discrepancies.
Deliverable: A slide summarizing the OSINT analysis, highlighting correlations and potential impacts on the overall assessment.
4. Threat Assessment and Recommendations
Task: Assess potential threats based on the analysis, considering historical incidents and emerging patterns.
Deliverable: A slide with threat assessment, including recommendations for further monitoring, intelligence gathering, and other actions for the intelligence team.
5. Presentation of Findings
Task: Prepare a presentation summarizing key findings from all tasks. Focus on clarity and conciseness, ensuring that senior intelligence officials can understand the implications.
Deliverable: A PowerPoint or PDF presentation, including separate slides for each task with visualizations and recommendations.

How to Run the Analysis
Geospatial Analysis:

Use Python with libraries such as geopandas, matplotlib, and folium to perform geospatial analysis and create heat maps.
Run the script geospatial_analysis.py located in the scripts/ folder.
Satellite Details Interpretation:

Analyze the provided satellite images manually or using tools such as OpenCV or skimage.
Use the script satellite_analysis.py for preliminary image processing.
OSINT Correlation:

Cross-reference the findings from geospatial analysis and satellite data with the news reports.
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques with libraries like nltk or spaCy if automated text analysis is needed.
Threat Assessment:

Combine all the analysis to assess potential threats.
The threat assessment summary can be generated using threat_assessment.py.
Generate Presentation:

Compile the findings and visualizations into a PowerPoint presentation using matplotlib, seaborn, or Pandas for visualizations.
